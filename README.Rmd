## Overview

The _projmaker_ should help to setup a project (*create_project.cmd*) at 
GeoInsights and clean-up when ready (*cleanup_project.cmd*).

In future projects, a common structure for folders and a common guideline for 
file naming should be applied.

In general, this tools help you to setup a corpus (minimal set) of folders 
structured according to a general workflow typical at GeoInsights.

Feel free to add or delete folders (e.g. *0111_regiograph_files*).

There should be ample room for individual modifications to create a best 
structure for any given project.
Especially the top level folder structure should remain as proposed here.

Currently, the convention for naming project folders is

  * for Market Data: *studyname_CTR_YYYY*, e.g. *superproject_CZE_2019* 
  * for Client Projects: *clientproject_CTR_YYYYMM*, e.g. *megaservice_CZE_201904*. 

This means: 

  * no spaces, german umlauts, special characters, etc. 
  * *capital ISO3 country codes* (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3).

If you have suggestions please contact 
[Christoph Stepper](mailto:christoph.stepper@gfk.com) or 
[Anja Waldmann](mailto:anja.waldmann@gfk.com).

## Current structure

At the moment, the directory tree for an initialized project looks like:

[//]: # (run in cmd: tree /f and copy output from cmd)


```bash
├───00_basedata						# raw (delivered) data sets and data documentation; input only - i.e. never to be overwridden!
│   ├───001_data						# the data itself
│   └───002_metadata					# documentation for the data
├───01_analysis						# anything to do with analysis/work-in-progress
│   ├───0101_data						# intermediate data sets, e.g. results from individual analysis modules (tip: name subfolders corresponding to your R-scripts and save your data)
│   ├───0110_code						# all code files, i.e. R code, py code, SAS code, etc.
│   │   ├───01100_r_functions				# R functions necessary for projects (longer than a 3-liner), but not worth to be put into a GIpackage; sourced within scripts to avoid code repetition	
│   │   ├───01101_r_scripts					# R scripts for all analysis steps/modules, named in a comprehensible way (tip: number scrips in the order they need to be executed)	
│   │   └───01102_r_markdowns				#  if applicable, R markdown files (eg. for documentations etc.)
│   ├───0120_figures					# any static or interactive visualisations generated during the analysis
│   ├───0121_leaflets					# any map visualisation generated during the analysis
│   ├───0130_checks						# anything that is to be checked by people other than the analysis author, e.g. excel comparison files in purchasing power
│   └───0140_misc						# place for things that somehow do not fit into any of the above, e.g. colour definitions for logos
├───02_docu							# project documentation and final checks (Checkliste)
├───03_results						# final results that are to be delivered to the client or that are to be pushed to our official products
└───04_presentations				# things for kick-of/intermediate/final presentations
```


## General remarks

If you work with R, it is generally a good idea to set the __Workspace Options__ as follows:

1. Uncheck _Restore .RData into workspace at startup_
2. Set _Save workspace to .RData on exit:_ to __Never__

Additionally, I strongly advice you to uncheck _Always save history (even when not saving .RData)_.
Have you ever had a look into your saved *.Rhistory* files in any project? I didn't.

![](figures/workspace_settings_RStudio.png)	

It is advisable to use _RStudio Projects_ when working in a project mostly done in R.  
Doing so, you can use relative paths to navigate to files within the project and 
the project keeps working when moved to another location (e.g. another drive).

## Setup and workflow

### Setup

To use the *projmaker*, the easiest option would be to clone the repository to 
your machine and use it from there. 

If you only want to use one batch file, feel free to download it directly.

### Generate folder structure

To generate a valid folder structure, just follow these steps:

1. Copy the *create_project.cmd* into the root directory where the new project 
   should be locatad in.
2. Execute the file by left double-click.
3. Follow the user prompts to setup the folder structure.
	+ Enter a valid name for the study, etc.
	+ Delete *cmd* from the root directory (either automatically or manually).
	
Here are two examples for both cases:

* Market Data

  ![](figures/create_project_marketdata.png)
	
* Client Project

  ![](figures/create_project_clientproject.png)

### Setup RStudio project

To setup the project, open RStudio and execute:

1. Navigate to _Project: (None)_ (topright in RStudio GUI) and click on _New Project_

	![](figures/proj_1.png)
	
2. Select: Create Project in _Existing Directory_

	![](figures/proj_2.png)

3. Navigate to your project directory to set this as project working directory

	![](figures/proj_3.png)
	
When a new RStudio project is created,

* a project file (named _\*.proj_) is created within the project directory, 
  containing various project settings,
* a hidden directory (named _.Rproj.user_) is created, where project specific 
  temporary files are stored.

![](figures/proj_4.png)

If you want to version control your project with _Git_, navigate to the Project 
Options and select _Git_ as Version control system. 

Then a new git repository gets initialized (hidden _.git_ folder and 
_.gitignore_ file in project working directory).

### Clean-up empty directories

There might be some folders in your project directory tree which you did 
not use while working on your project.

In order to keep our folder structure as tidy as possible, we'd advice you to 
remove all empty folders after finishing your analysis.

You can use the *cleanup_project.cmd* to execute this task:

1. Copy the *cleanup_project.cmd* into the root directory of your project 
   (e.g. "P:/03_marketdata/CZE/superproject_CZE_2019").
2. Execute the file by left double-click.
3. Follow the user prompts to remove all empty directories (incl. subdirectories)
	+ Delete *cmd* from the root directory (either automatically or manually)
	
Here's an examples for removing all empty directories:

## Remarks

### Spinning R files

If you want to spin R files (--> Markdown --> html) within a project, you should set the _R Markdown Option_ as follows:

* Evaluate chunks in directory: _Project_
 
![](figures/RMarkdown_settings_RStudio.png)


### Windows Context Menu

> NOTE: Make changes to the Windows *registry* with caution. Edits may harm the 
  behavior of your computer.

If you're tired of copying the batch files over and over again to the target 
directories, you can add them to the _Right Click Menu_ of your file explorer.

Therefore, you need to tweak the *registry*. Simply add two new keys for the 
batch files into the following root in your registry.

```
Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell
```

You can add them either manually by opening the *Registry Editor* or by 
executing the provided *.reg* files (in the "reg" directory) - make sure that 
the links are pointing to the right location where your batch files sit!

Check if the keys were correctly set in your registry:

1. Lauch __regedit.exe__ from the Start menu
   
   ![](figures/regedit.png)

2. Navigate to the __HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell__ key 
   and check if there are the two newly created keys *create_project* and 
   *cleanup_project*. 
   
   ![](figures/registry_directory_background.png)

3. You can evaluate the given value for your key (Default) 
   string by double-clicking *(Default)* and see what's in the *Value data* field.
   
   ![](figures/registry_command_value.png)

Now you can easily open the batch scripts at any location. Just upen the 
Right Click Context Menu (by right clicking in the background - 
*not on a file or directory*) and select the task you want to run.
It gets executed in the current directory.
